Latex Templates
===============

This is a repository strictly for the collection of LaTeX files and templates I've found over the years.

MLA
----

The MLA format includes [mla.sty](/mla/mla13.sty) and should include a bibliography.

Navy
----

The Navy folder includes an [example.tex](/Navy/example.tex) file and the corresponding 
document type, [navy.cls](/Navy/navy.cls).  This is an example I made for NROTC.

MATLAB
----

The Matlab folder includes a same MATLAB code file [examplecode.m](/Matlab/examplecode.m), 
a same tex file [example.tex](/Matlab/example.tex) which shows proper use, and a
corresponding image output.
