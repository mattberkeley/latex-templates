\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,} 
 
\noindent I am writing to express my interest in a position as a Retail Sales Associate at Rejuvenation.


\noindent  I am a Mechanical Engineer at UC Berkeley looking for a part-time position in retail.  I worked for five years in a small business in a managerial position and have had much experience with sales and costumer service.  Additionally, I am in the NROTC program at Berkeley and as such am highly professional, fit, organized and detail-oriented.

\noindent  My five years of experience in retail and costumer service, coupled with my technological and physical skills make me a terrific fit for Rejuvenation.  In the enclosed resume a list of my technical skills and customer service related experience which make me a valuable asset to Rejuvenation can be found.  

 
\noindent I am very interested in a personal interview to discuss what I benefit I would bring to Rejuvenation, if hired.  I can be contacted at (559) 363-9716 and by email at matt\.uhs$@$me.com.  Thank you for your consideration and your time.  
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
